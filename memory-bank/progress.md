## April 9, 2025 - Symbol Cache Improvements

Significant technical improvements were made to the symbol caching system, enhancing performance and robustness:

**1. Cache Detection Optimization:**

- Added metadata tracking with timestamps for cached application symbols.
- Implemented efficient detection of unchanged apps, skipping redundant processing.
- Added pruning mechanism for stale metadata entries to manage cache size.
- Resolved initialization issues for more reliable startup.
  _Benefit: Faster symbol processing, reduced resource usage._

**2. Configurable Processing Delay:**

- Introduced a new VSCode setting `bc-al-upgradeassistant.symbolCache.processingDelay`.
- Default delay set to 25000ms (25 seconds), minimum configurable to 100ms.
- Added validation for configuration values, falling back to the default if invalid.
  _Benefit: Allows users to tune symbol processing timing based on system performance and project size._

**3. System Robustness Enhancements:**

- Corrected initialization of tracking variables (`skippedCount`, `newProcedures`).
- Improved error handling during symbol parsing and caching.
- Enhanced handling of edge cases for broader compatibility.
- Implemented a non-blocking delay mechanism to prevent UI freezes.
  _Benefit: Increased reliability, better user experience, and more resilient symbol caching._

## What Works

- **AL Code Filtering:** The refactored code for filtering modern AL code now works through the submodule. The functionality has been moved to `al-parser-lib/alparser.js` and is used by `src/utils/alCodeFilter.js`.

## What's Left

- **Testing:** Need to verify the refactored code works correctly with various AL code inputs.
- **Documentation:** Update any documentation that references the AL code filtering functionality.

## Current Status

- **Refactoring Complete:** The AL code filtering functionality has been successfully moved to the submodule.
- **Memory Bank Updated:** All relevant Memory Bank files have been updated to reflect the changes.

## Known Issues

- **Potential Regression:** The refactoring might have introduced subtle changes in behavior that need to be tested.
- **Submodule Management:** Need to ensure proper Git workflow for managing changes to the submodule.

## Evolution of Decisions

- **Code Organization:** Decision to move AL parsing logic to the submodule to improve separation of concerns and potential reuse.
- **Dependency Management:** Using dependency injection (passing `isIdInRanges` as a parameter) to avoid circular dependencies between the main project and the submodule.
