# Progress Tracking

_This file logs what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions._

## What Works

- **AL Code Filtering:** The refactored code for filtering modern AL code now works through the submodule. The functionality has been moved to `al-parser-lib/alparser.js` and is used by `src/utils/alCodeFilter.js`.

## What's Left

- **Testing:** Need to verify the refactored code works correctly with various AL code inputs.
- **Documentation:** Update any documentation that references the AL code filtering functionality.

## Current Status

- **Refactoring Complete:** The AL code filtering functionality has been successfully moved to the submodule.
- **Memory Bank Updated:** All relevant Memory Bank files have been updated to reflect the changes.

## Known Issues

- **Potential Regression:** The refactoring might have introduced subtle changes in behavior that need to be tested.
- **Submodule Management:** Need to ensure proper Git workflow for managing changes to the submodule.

## Evolution of Decisions

- **Code Organization:** Decision to move AL parsing logic to the submodule to improve separation of concerns and potential reuse.
- **Dependency Management:** Using dependency injection (passing `isIdInRanges` as a parameter) to avoid circular dependencies between the main project and the submodule.
